Hallo, I'm Anirudh Maiya. I currently work as a software engineer at Commvault. I obtained my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from PES University, Bangalore.
Previously I was a project intern at NRSC-ISRO where I worked on estimating Coconut Plantations from the data obtained from Cartosat-2.

My research interests lie at the intersection of time series principles and optimization in machine learning. I also enjoy working on problems related to remote sensing domain. I've made some [progress](https://anirudhmaiya.github.io/publications){:target="_blank"}.

I enjoy cycling my way across Bengaluru on the weekends. I also am a Formula 1 nerd. Lewis Hamilton and Luka Doncic are my favourite athletes.

Thanks for reading!
