Hallo, I'm Anirudh Maiya. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. I previously worked as a Software Engineer in the Cloud-Sevices team at Commvault, where my primary role involved developing code to support Commvault employees in staging customer data on the Commvault Cloud platform.
Before that I was a project intern at Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) where I focused on estimating Coconut Plantations using data acquired from Cartosat-2.

My research interests lie at the intersection of time series principles and optimization in machine learning. I also enjoy working on problems related to remote sensing domain. I've made some [progress](https://anirudhmaiya.github.io/publications){:target="_blank"}.

I enjoy cycling my way around Boulder on the weekends. I also am a Formula 1 nerd. Lewis Hamilton and Luka Doncic are my favourite athletes.

Thanks for reading!
