	<h3><strong>Commvault</strong></h3>
	<strong>Software Engineer</strong>
	<br/>
	<em><sub>January 2022 - August 2023</sub></em>
	<ul>
	<li> Elevated success rate for Commvault Cloud’s Remote Troubleshooting from 85% to 98%. Tailored a Commvault
	Report to monitor error rates, expediting prioritization of bugs and defects linked to Remote Troubleshooting </li>
	<li> Migrated and refactored a legacy codebase exceeding 35,000 lines for Remote Troubleshooting, upgrading it
	from Python 2.7 to Python 3.9. Introduced dependency management, log scrubbing, generic retry APIs, and
	incorporated keys to streamline code adaptability for both production and test environments </li>
	<li> Managed and updated the Commvault Plugin for ServiceNow to align with ServiceNow Store regulation </li>
	<li> Subject matter expert for Commvault integration with ServiceNow </li>
	</ul>
