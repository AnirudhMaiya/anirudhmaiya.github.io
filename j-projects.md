- <b>Rethinking SWATS (Switching from Adam to SGD) Optimizer</b> <br/>
A variant of SWATS optimizer which outperforms vanilla SWATS in terms of test accuracy by 1.3 % for ResNet-18 and 1.4 % for DenseNet-121 on Cifar-10 dataset. <br/>

- <b>messup: A new regularization method</b> <br/>
A new regularization technique by encountering samples through exponential smoothing inspired by mixup regularization. This reduces generalization error by 1.6 % when compared to ERM. <br/>

- <b>Symm-PPO</b> <br/>
A variant of OpenAI's popular reinforcement learning algorithm - Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Symm-PPO inculcates the analogy of new policy not being too different from the old one for the entropy term. Median rewards from Symm-PPO outperforms/is on-par with vanilla PPO. <br/>
